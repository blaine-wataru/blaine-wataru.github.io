Before reading any further, I would suggest you familiarize yourself with the following:
- [GamerGate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_controversy)
- [Serial Swatter](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/magazine/the-serial-swatter.html)
- [ACM Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-code-of-ethics-and-professional-conduct)

# What are Ethics?

Let's start by talking about Ethics. What is Ethics? Rather than pulling something pointless from the dictionary, I'd rather define Ethics how I see it from my perspective, in the context of Software Engineering.

Ethics as it is defined from person to person can be difficult to place properly within the context of our lives. One person's definition of what is ethical may not line up with that of another person. People can also perform actions that most would consider unethical, but then justify it to themselves as OK. In order to combat this, we as software engineers need a common code of ethics that everybody can agree on.

Enter the ACM Code of Ethics. The ACM Code allows software engineers to define what is ethical and what isn't, and gives us a code of conduct to follow so we can be relatively sure we're doing the right thing (I say relatively because you may disagree with the Code of Ethics for one reason or another, or the Code might even be wrong itself). Therefore, using the ACM Code of Ethics as a backdrop, we can define ethics in the context of software engineering as a set of moral standards we uphold as agreed upon by the community, to try to live life with as much moral standing and goodness as we can.

# Online Harassment (and How it Relates to Ethics)

Now that we've defined ethics, let's talk about two specific cases of online harassment and how that relates to our definition of Ethics: **GamerGate** and **The Serial Swatter.** In case you're in a hurry and/or lazy and don't want to read additional background information, GamerGate and the Serial Swatter are harassment cases using tools online such as Twitter, Twitch, Skype, and Facebook, as well as doxxing, blackmail, DDOSing, and other forms of online harassment. GamerGate in particular was about the harassment of various female game developers, while The Serial Swatter involved harassment of several female streamers on Twitch. People will generally agree the actions of the harassers were extermely unethical, so I'm not gonna bother with that. Rather, I'd like to analyze why exactly things like these happen, and what we can do about it as software engineers to prevent it from happening again.

## Why did it happen?

People have always bullied and harassed each other for as long as civilized society has existed, but it's definitely made a rise in modern society with the advent of social media and the internet. People who have never met or interacted before sling mud over the internet in the worst way possible. Things like doxxing, death threats, blackmail, and such were never as widespread as they are today. Bullying and harassment has stepped up its game in a way never seen before. But why?

A major part of the reason harassment exists online in the form it does is due to the anonymity of the internet. The anonymity of the internet breeds a relatively consequence-free environment where people can say or do as they please without being linked to their image in real life. There's no real threat of retaliation (banning and verbal retaliation doesn't really deter people), and no permanent image or account they need to protect (as anyone banned from anything can easily circumvent it with other accounts and proxies, and easily pretend to be someone else to shed their negative reputation), so harassment naturally comes out as people are essentially allowed to do whatever they want.

That isn't the only reason anonymity breeds harassment. Anonymity also hides the recipient of the harassment. Since people are not interacting directly, a lot of times many people will subconciously disconnect the person behind the keyboard and the target of their harassment, making it easier to justify their behavior to themselves. In general, a lot of people would never do the same kind of thing in real life to an actual person as they would over the internet.

## Whose fault is it?

Ignoring the obvious, is there anything the developers of platforms that allowed this to happen could've done? Could Twitter have done anything to prevent this behavior? What about Facebook? Or 

## So what can we do?
