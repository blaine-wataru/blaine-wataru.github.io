Ever since I was a kid, I always liked making things and being creative. When I was in Elementary School, my favorite things to do were all creative outlets. I played pretend with my friends. I made custom trading card games, comic books, video game guidebooks, and video game level designs. All I could think about was making things. 

Fast forward to high school. Again, I loved making things, creating, but in different, more applicable ways. I started a band. I wrote songs for myself to get out my teenage angst. I wrote plays, some of which I submitted to competitions in New York (no success stories, though). I drew anime and manga characters, and thought up stories in my head. When I was in high school, I thought I wanted to be a famous musician, and I spent my days wondering if it could happen.

Now I'm in college, and I've put those pipe dreams away. But it doesn't mean I haven't forgotten what I love to do: create. Now I apply my creative process to programming. I love making games, creating new programs, and am interested in developing software or websites, which is another form of creation. I love the feeling of sitting back and being proud of something you made, staring you in the face, and I think I will continue to enjoy the feeling for a long time to come.
