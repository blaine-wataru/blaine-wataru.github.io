## Introduction

When constructing a website, a developer needs to think about the kind of tools he wants to use. What are the benefits to using different kinds of toolsets? Are different toolsets easier to use than others? What do different toolsets allow you to do? The main toolset I wanna look at today is [Semantic UI.](https://semantic-ui.com/)

Semantic UI is one of many toolsets known as UI Frameworks. It shares this title with other toolsets like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/) (which I have not used, so I will not talk about them here. No comparisons today, everyone!) UI Frameworks allow web developers access to a simple and easy way to design websites, without wading through raw HTML to do so.

## Why Use UI Frameworks?

Why should I use a UI Framework? What benefit does it give me over raw HTML and CSS? Am I going to be annoyed learning something new? Let's tackle all these questions right now! (NOTE: The developers at Semantic UI are not paying me, although that would be really nice. If you guys are reading this, send me free stuff!)

# Pros
**Semantic UI is actually really easy to learn.** Semantic UI uses intuitive natural language to make it easy do what you want to do. If you want something centered, just use the "centered" keyword. It's pretty much as easy as that. There's also a lot of overlap on variations for each seperate element. For example, you can use the "centered" keyword on text, images, grids, and so on.

**It's a lot easier to do what you want** Rather than coding every interaction of the webpage yourself, Semantic UI allows you to use classes which do most of the work for you. Wanna make a dropdown menu? It's as easy as using a dropdown and menu class, adding the item classes in, and adding some Javascript to put it all together.

# Cons
**You have to learn another language**
**You might not understand everything at the base level**
