## Introduction

When constructing a website, a developer needs to think about the kind of tools he wants to use. What are the benefits to using different kinds of toolsets? Are different toolsets easier to use than others? What do different toolsets allow you to do? The main toolset I wanna look at today is [Semantic UI.](https://semantic-ui.com/)

Semantic UI is one of many toolsets known as UI Frameworks. It shares this title with other toolsets like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/) (which I have not used, so I will not talk about them here. No comparisons today, everyone!) UI Frameworks allow web developers access to a simple and easy way to design websites, without wading through raw HTML to do so.

## Why Use Semantic UI?

Why should I use Semantic UI? What benefit does it give me over raw HTML and CSS? Am I going to be annoyed learning something new? Let's tackle all these questions right now! (NOTE: The developers at Semantic UI are not paying me, although that would be really nice. If you guys are reading this, send me free stuff!)

### Pros
- **Semantic UI is actually really easy to learn.** Semantic UI uses intuitive natural language to make it easy do what you want to do. If you want something centered, just use the "centered" keyword. It's pretty much as easy as that. There's also a lot of overlap on variations for each seperate element. For example, you can use the "centered" keyword on text, images, grids, and so on.
- **It's a lot easier to do what you want.** Rather than coding every interaction of the webpage yourself, Semantic UI allows you to use classes which do most of the work for you. Wanna make a dropdown menu? It's as easy as using a dropdown and menu class, adding the item classes in, and adding some Javascript to put it all together.

### Cons
- **You have to learn another language.** Learning new languages is hard. Remembering syntax is hard (I definitely can't do it; thank god for Google). It might be easier to stick with what you know. If you already know how to do what you want using raw HTML and CSS, it's difficult to justify making the switch if it won't let you do anything you can't already do.
- **You might not understand everything at the base level.** The danger of using things like classes and functions that are part of some hidden library is that you don't really understand how it works. When you use a method or class from a library (for an easy example, Java's *.push* method), you simply plug in the parameters and it spits out the outcome. You most likely won't know or understand what's going on under the hood because the inner workings of the classes are hidden from you. To use the *.push* example, you may understand that *.push* pushes an item onto the end of the linked list, but you won't know that it does so by changing the tail of the list and editing the next fields of the old tail to attach to the new node. Likewise, if your code doesn't work for whatever reason, it'll be harder to debug because you won't understand the methods and classes you're using.

## Conclusions

Semantic UI (or any other UI framework) is an essential tool for any web developer, both veteran and aspiring. UI frameworks have a lot of flexibility and are much more intuitive and easier to use in comparison to developing everything yourself with straight up HTML and CSS. However, it does help to also have an understanding of actual HTML and CSS as it will strengthen your understanding of web development at the base level as well as how UI frameworks do their job. 

Is Semantic UI worth learning? Absolutely yes. Is it necessary? Probably not. If you are comfortable with whatever you're using currently, and don't need Semantic UI to do it, it's hard to justify learning it. But it never hurts to add another tool to your software engineering arsenal.
