> "There's no such thing as a stupid question." -Your 5th grade teacher, probably.

## Introduction
So I was reading [this amazing article](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) provided to our ICS314 class at UH Manoa, and I was thinking to myself the whole time, "YES! THIS IS EXACTLY HOW I FEEL!". After I finished reading it, I wanted to give my insight on "asking questions the smart way."

A lot of people have probably told you that there's no such thing as a stupid question. This is only half true. Asking questions should be encouraged over staying silent and not asking, and therefore not knowing,  but there definitely are stupid questions that people should not ask, and I'm gonna tell you what they are.

## What is a stupid question?
It would be foolish of me to rag on stupid questions without really explaining what I mean by that, wouldn't it? And there's nothing wrong with asking questions to learn, or for clarification, or any reason you would ask a question. What constitutes a stupid question is really *the manner in which it is asked.* In other words, there are no stupid questions, but there are stupid ways to ask them.

Well, what's a stupid way to ask a question? A "dumb" question primarily consists of one or more of the following factors:

- **The asker clearly didn't make any attempt to figure out the solution on their own.** The asker did not do any of their own testing/investigation, or search for the answer through resources like books or Google. Please make an attempt to figure it out yourself first. You might even get the answer and not have to ask the question at all.
- **The asker is imprecise about what they want.** The question is often vague or confused, or asks for a different answer than the one the asker actually wants. Be precise about what you want when you ask your question.
- **The asker makes it difficult for anyone to help them.** Again, the question is confused and difficult to understand, but also the necessary details may not be provided to allow people to help, and/or the asker will shoot down requests for further information. Add as many relevant details as you can, and work with the people helping you, not against them. It also helps to be straight and to the point, and avoid useless nonsense like "HELP PLS".
- **The question is inappropriate.** Usually this is just asking the wrong people. Check to make sure you're asking your question in the right environment. For example don't pose low-level noobie questions in expert environments, or ask a Java expert questions about networking (the computer kind).
- **Bad spelling and grammar.** Bad spelling/grammar doesn't seem relevant to most people, particularly if both parties understand the intent, but it shows a lack of care on the asker's part, like they couldn't even be bothered to spell check or anything. However, people might make exceptions if you are not a native speaker, and say so.

Most of these points illustrate one major thing: Don't look to be spoonfed the answer.  Whenever you are asking a question, always ask yourself this one question: *Do you want an answer, or do you want to learn?* If you just want an answer, and you say something like "Here's my code. It doesn't work. Fix it.", how does that help anyone? You learn nothing, and you irritate whoever you asked because they know you learn nothing. It's disrespectful, helps no one, and is honestly just downright lazy. When you ask a question this way, you check all 3 of these "dumb question factors". Don't do that. Don't be stupid.

Smart people are also more likely to answer smart questions. In general, smart people don't like answering stupid questions (especially for free!) since they're a waste of time for everyone involved. The answerer is not challenged, and the asker is not learning anything. If you want good answers, and to learn from your questions, ask questions the smart way, so that smart people will answer them.

## Well, show me! 
Here's a couple excerpts from StackOverflow that I found, which I hope will illustrate what constitutes a good or bad question.

### Bad Question
These are a list of bad questions:

1. [How to define a constructor outside class in Java?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32627456/how-to-define-a-constructor-outside-class-in-java)
2. [What is (int)?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25180631/what-is-int)
3. [Is this JavaScript code OK?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43719039/is-this-javascript-code-ok)
4. [Where are syntax errors am getting? (sic)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30449692/where-are-the-syntax-errors-am-getting)

What's wrong with these questions? Well, let's break it down. These are all the problems that can be found in these questions:

- **For Question 1 + 2:** Answer could've easily been found by Googling. Very basic conceptual questions, and yet the asker does not ask for something like clarification or simplification, or show that they have done any research at all.
- **For Question 3:** Question is extremely vague both with what it wants and information provided. What does "OK code" mean? What does the asker want? What is the output? What is the goal of the program?
- **For Question 4:** Asker is unhelpful. Simply posts a huge block of code and a long error log, without explaining what he's tried or where he's stuck. Clearly just looking for correct code without caring why. Also, bad grammar shows a lack of care.

By looking at the comments and the quality of answers the askers received, we can see these are bad questions. Many answers were one-liners and don't go into depth at all, with only a couple answers in total. Comments are scathing, where some people even say nothing more than "google it". One answer is even nothing more than corrected code without any attempt to explain it. If you ask stupid questions, this is what you will receive on average. Avoid this so you can get good responses.

### Good Question
These are a couple good questions:

1. [Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-it-faster-to-process-a-sorted-array-than-an-unsorted-array)
2. [What and where are the stack and heap?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79923/what-and-where-are-the-stack-and-heap)
3. [SQLException: no suitable driver found for jdbc:mysql between two maven projects](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45771942/sqlexception-no-suitable-driver-found-for-jdbcmysql-between-two-maven-projects)

In comparison to the bad questions, what do these questions do right?

- **For Question 1+2:** Asker shows that he's investigated the problem by showing the steps he took to understand it, and is looking to understand the why. For question 1, asker also provides relevant code and data. Both askers specifically ask what they want to know.
- **For Question 2:** Asker provides relevant data, code, and errors. Asker lists things he's tried and says he has already investigated StackOverflow to no avail. Asker is again specific about what he wants to know.

The quality of these questions' answers and comments is much higher. The answers are plentiful with very in-depth explanations and solutions, particularly for Questions 1 and 2. The comments section in Question 3 also consists of a lot of in-depth troubleshooting which was most likely very helpful for the asker. 

## So What Did We Learn?

Looking at the quality of responses from the good questions compared to the bad ones is like night and day. Looking at the questions and analyzing them (as well as reading the essay), I (and hopefully you too!) gained a lot of insight into what constitutes a good, smart, question versus a bad, stupid, question, the quality of answers and responses each type of question will receive, and how to make sure I ask questions the smart way versus the stupid way. 

So remember, whevnever you ask a question, don't ask it like an idiot would. Ask it like a smart person would. Don't ask stupid questions, ask smart ones.
