> "There's no such thing as a stupid question." -Your mom, probably.

A lot of people have probably told you that there's no such thing as a stupid question. This is only half true. Asking questions should be encouraged over staying silent and not asking, and therefore not knowing,  but there definitely are stupid questions that people should not ask, and I'm gonna tell you what they are.

## What is a stupid question?

It would be foolish of me to rag on stupid questions without really explaining what I mean by that, wouldn't it? And there's nothing wrong with asking questions to learn, or for clarification, or any reason you would ask a question. What constitutes a stupid question is really *the manner in which it is asked.* In other words, there are no stupid questions, but there are stupid ways to ask them.

Well, what's a stupid way to ask a question? A "dumb" question primarily consists of one or more of the following factors:

- The asker clearly didn't make any attempt to figure out the solution on their own, whether through their own testing/investigation, or searching for the answer through things like books or Google.
- The asker is imprecises about what information they want.
