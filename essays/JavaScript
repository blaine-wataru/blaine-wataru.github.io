## Introduction

Going into ICS 314, I knew nothing about JavaScript, and was only familiar with C/C++ and Java. The only thing that I knew was that it had the word Java in it, so maybe it was related to Java (not true, in actuality; JavaScript has nothing to do with Java). Doing some research, I learned it was a language primarily used in web development, and I was first exposed to it in ICS 314, where I picked up the basics with the help of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

## Thoughts on JavaScript

JavaScript is kind of an interesting language. So far it seems to be simpler than Java, since things like type mismatch, and main function don't really need to be accounted for (although types can be utilized). Due to the existence of let/const/var, the user doesn't need to declare types, which makes it easier and more intuitive to use. However, it's difficult to get a handle on the full capabilities of JavaScript as so far, I've only used it in simple ways for simple programs, and would have to get more experience with it to determine if it is a strong, functional language. However, I have taken a liking to it so far, and am interested to see its applications in relation to web development.

## Learning JavaScript with ICS 314

In ICS314, we learned JavaScript through what our professor Philip Johnson calls "athletic software engineering". It involves using repetition and practice in order to achieve mastery of the material through what Prof. Johnson calls the "Workout of the Day",  or WOD. WODs are semi-daily timed programming problems designed to be solved in an average of 5-10 minutes. 

I think WODs are somewhat stressful considering the all-or-nothing nature of the grading, particularly if you get a "Did Not Finish" (DNF) for the WOD as a result of a possible mistake in the code or being stuck on the problem for too long. However, particularly in a technical interview, you will be asked to do something similar to WODs, where you will need to solve a problem quickly and accurately for your interviewers. Therefore, I don't think the high-stress nature of WODs is necessarily a bad thing.

WODs are useful particularly for getting practice with the material and learning to not only solve problems, but solve them quickly and efficiently. It's never good to take forever to solve relatively trivial problems, as it will slow down your work once you encounter more complicated problems. WODs are also fairly quick provided you can solve them quickly without needing to reattempt them, which makes them easier to do without too much time commitment.

However, it's important for a software engineer to understand that problems must not only be solved in a decent amount of time, but also solved correctly. If it takes a little bit of extra time to test your solution and debug it, it is much better than releasing a shoddy, broken product in the quickest time possible. I believe that students should focus on correctness over everything, and the speed will come with practice and mastery.

## Summary

Overall, I am a fan of JavaScript and the "athletic software engineering". I think JavaScript is a useful language for me to learn to dip my feet into web development, and I like it's so far shown relative simplicity. Athletic software engineering has also been useful to encourage me to think more quickly and accurately, and not waste time unnecessarily, to optimize my mastery of programming and software development.
