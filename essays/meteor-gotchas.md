## Introduction

Meteor. While the name sounds incredibly awesome, there are a couple things that are...not so awesome. When trying to get Meteor to work on my system, I ran into a couple problems that made it a lot harder to get started developing.

## What is Meteor?

If you're not familiar, Meteor is a web application development tool used in constructing, well, web apps. It's primarily run through the command line and developed through a text editor or IDE. Meteor is helpful for compiling a bunch of html, js, and css files in order to construct your web app in real time, as you develop. You can download [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) if you want to try it for yourself.

## Problems

**For reference, I am running a Windows 10 machine with a Intel i7 2.6 GHz Processor.**

While Meteor is a great tool, I did have a couple of problems, that I assume are specific to the Windows version of Meteor, and I will be talking about my experiences with them below. Some of them I solved, and some I didn't.

### Problem 1
The first, and major problem involved Meteor runtimes. There was a particular case in my ICS314 class involving an exercise called [Digits](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f17/morea/meteor-2/experience-meteor-digits-1.html).  I had trouble running a meteor create command on this exercise in the apps folder: it took over 20 MINUTES. That's a long time. A REALLY long time. 

Actually, that was my only problem. I know I said there were a number of problems, but I honestly had no troubles outside of this issue. SO in conclusion, Meteor, fix your Windows version/
