## Introduction

JavaScript is kind of an interesting language. So far it seems to be simpler than Java, since things like type mismatch, main function, and classes don't really need to be accounted for. Due to the existence of let/const/var, the user doesn't need to declare types, which makes it easier and more intuitive to use. However, it's difficult to get a handle on the full capabilities of JavaScript as so far, I've only used it in simple ways for simple programs, and would have to get more experience with it to determine if it is a strong, functional language. However, I have taken a liking to it so far, and am interested to see its applications in relation to web development.
