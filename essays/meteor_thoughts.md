## Introduction

> The Tunguska Event is a famous explosion that occurred in Siberia in the morning of June 30, 1908. Believed to be an air explosion of possibly some sort of meteoroid, the Tunguska Event is often famous in popular culture as an crash landing an alien spaceship which introduced extraterrestrial technology to Earth.

That's super interesting and all, but what does any of that have to do with [Meteor,](https://www.meteor.com/) the web development platform? Absolutely nothing, to be quite honest (other than the fact that the word "Meteor" is involved). But I guess I would say that the idea of the Tunguska Event as a "first contact" with aliens, can be compared to my introduction to development with Meteor as my "first contact" with web development. And now, I'm gonna tell you guys all about how Meteor introduced me to the world of web development: you'll get to hear about the good times, and the bad times. So what are we waiting for? Let's jump right in.

## Getting Started

When I first downloaded Meteor, I didn't know what to expect. Was Meteor an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse ? Was it a client that compiler like gcc or CLISP? Or was it something else entirely? When I downloaded and installed Meteor, I heard from my ICS314 professor that one person had failed to get Meteor running for *weeks.* **WEEKS.** Was that going to be me? What if it was? Was I just going to be royally and completely screwed?

Turns out, that wasn't me. I got Meteor running pretty quickly with virtually no hiccups whatsoever. Or so I thought.

As I began learning Meteor, I began to notice that it was slow. Like *REALLY* slow.

## Thoughts?

### Pros
- Reloads in real time
- MongoDB is very simple and easy to use


### Cons
- Command line is confusing, would prefer an actual desktop client
- Really slow and inefficient

## Conclusions
