## Introduction

> The Tunguska Event is a famous explosion that occurred in Siberia in the morning of June 30, 1908. Believed to be an air explosion of possibly some sort of meteoroid, the Tunguska Event is often famous in popular culture as an crash landing an alien spaceship which introduced extraterrestrial technology to Earth.

That's super interesting and all, but what does any of that have to do with [Meteor,](https://www.meteor.com/) the web development platform? Absolutely nothing, to be quite honest (other than the fact that the word "Meteor" is involved). But I guess I would say that the idea of the Tunguska Event as a "first contact" with aliens, can be compared to my introduction to development with Meteor as my "first contact" with web development.
