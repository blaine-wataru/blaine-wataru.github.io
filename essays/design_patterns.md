## Introduction to Design Patterns

At some point when reading this essay, it may be beneficial to [familiarize yourself](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns) with the different types of design patterns. I'm not gonna explain each pattern individually, as that's not what I want to talk about here, but rather I want to help you understand what design patterns are conceptually, and why you should (or shouldn't) use design patterns in your own software development process.

Back in the old days of programming, when no one knew anything about anything, people solved problems in their own ways, using their own methodology and ideas, sort of how you and me did starting out. If someone asked you to make a basic program that, for example, pulled information from a file line by line, you'd maybe think after some time: "I can use a for loop to go through the file line by line and save that information to an array!" And you'd be right.

Then let's say later down the line, some other guy wants to do the same thing you did (pull information from a file line by line). Instead of him struggling to come up with the algorithm, wouldn't it be easier to tell him: "Hey, you can solve that type of problem by doing something like this!" and you show him your algorithm.

Of course, this is kind of a gross oversimplification of the nature of design patterns, but it gets the concept across. Design patterns can be compared to keys and chord progressions in music. For example, a typical upbeat happy song might use something like the key of C or G, which are particularly keys that contain happy notes, and a I IV V chord progression, which makes the chords C/F/G to form the basic framework of your song. These musical tools are like design patterns because they are tools created by people who already solved the problem of "reading a file line by line," or "writing a happy song," so why not use what they know to solve the same problem instead of having to waste time thinking about a problem that already has a solution?

## How do I Use Design Patterns?

> "OK, you've convinced me. Design patterns are great. But how do I use them?" -You, probably.
