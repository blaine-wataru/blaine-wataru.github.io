##Introduction

In 2016, I became a raid leader for a online game called Final Fantasy XIV, which was a leader of a group of like-minded indivduals who banded together to defeat powerful AI opponents (i.e. raiding). Raiding in games like Final Fantasy XIV and World of Warcraft can teach a multiple of very important skills that are very applicable to the real world, and leading a raid group has definitely shaped my personality tremendously.

When I first joined Final Fantasy XIV back in 2015, I had no idea I would grow to be a competitve player, pushing for the top 1% of the 1% of all players. But as low to mid level content became "easy" I began pushing further and further to attempt to challenge myself with the game. I joined a raid group on a whim, and was introduced to an entirely different world: a world of optimization, perfect synchronization, and comradarie. I learned and reinforced skills like communication with your team to figure out the best way to handle a problem, making mistakes, owning up to them, and not making them again, doing your homework so you were prepared as to not waste everyone's time, and showing up on time, every time.

##Responsilities

The group I led was never a highly-competitve group (I found this later in another group I joined, but that's irrelevant), but we still followed these raiding principles. However, as a raid leader, I had to take up additional responsilibites.
