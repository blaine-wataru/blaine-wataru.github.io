Most people are very dismissive of video games, particularly Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG). But I believe that raiding in games like Final Fantasy XIV and World of Warcraft can teach a multiple of very important skills that are very applicable to the real world, and have shaped my personality tremendously.
